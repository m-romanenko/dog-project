## Dog Classification Project

Given an image of a dog, this algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

### Instructions

1. The dog dataset can be downloaded [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). You should then extract it to `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`. 

2. The human dataset can be downloaded [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip). You should then extract it at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`. 

3. Finally, download the [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset and place it to `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.

4. You can now run the Jupyter notebook and train the model !
